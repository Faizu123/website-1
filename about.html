        <h1>A javascript framework for the fastest, most advanced applications on the planet.</h1>
        <div id="slow">
          <p>When the web started, it was a collection of hyperlinked, static pages. Then people started creating dynamic content and applications, and the web overflowed with cgi-bin directories.</p>
          <p>The techniques for building these applications have become more advanced since then, with full-stack web frameworks like Ruby on Rails and Django becoming immensely popular. <strong>As the number of web users has grown, however, web apps have experienced difficulty scaling</strong> to fulfill the demand that a popular app can generate.</p>
          <p><strong>Even with consistently fast servers, the latency between those servers and your user is always outside your control.</strong> That means that even if you optimize your application as much as possible, every new request makes the user wait a minimum of a few hundred milliseconds. Compared to desktop apps, they just don’t feel as snappy, and impatient users can quickly turn into former users.</p>
          <p>Recently, AJAX has been used to create web pages that can update without having to reload the browser. But they still feel like websites, and are usually limited in interactivity.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="fast">
          <p><strong>SproutCore works by doing the only thing that can truly eliminate the latency problem: it moves your business logic to the client.</strong> SproutCore applications are full-fledged programs, written in JavaScript. That JavaScript executes in your user’s browser, freeing up your servers (and server engineers) to focus on what’s most important in a cloud application: delivering users’ data as quickly and reliably as possible.</p>
          <p>But SproutCore isn’t your mama’s JavaScript library. It isn’t meant to augment existing web pages. It isn’t meant to add animation to documents. SproutCore is a tool for building applications. <strong>It has more in common with Cocoa or .NET than jQuery or MooTools.</strong> Because of that, SproutCore will change the way you think about building web apps.</p>
          <p><strong>SproutCore is server-agnostic and will plug into your existing backend. What are you waiting for?</strong></p>
