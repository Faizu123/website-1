    <p>While SproutCore is not officially supported on platforms other than Windows, Mac OS X and Linux, if you
    are able to install Ruby gems, you may be able to install SproutCore. For more information about installing
    Ruby, see http://ruby-lang.org.</p>

    <h1>Installing SproutCore</h1>
    <p>If you were able to install Ruby, the next step is to try to install the gem. However, this may fail due
    to platform dependency issues. To give it a try, run:<br><br></p>
    <pre><code>$ gem install sproutcore</code></pre><br>
    <p>If this succeeded without errors, you're all set. From the command line you can now use any of the
      sc-* tools (sc-init, sc-gen, sc-server, ...)</p>
