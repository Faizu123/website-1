To view the SproutCore website, first install nanoc:

    gem install nanoc

Then run nanoc autocompile and load http://localhost:3000/ in your browser.

The templates for the site are located in layouts/.
Each content page is located in content/.

To configure navigation tabs, modify the metadata at the top of each page:

    ---
    title: SproutCore - About
    id: about
    h1: About SproutCore
    download: true
    subnav:
    - What is SproutCore
    - Who's Using SproutCore
    - Core Team
    - Logos
    ---

"title" is the title that is displayed in the browser.
"id" determines the active state of the main navigation at the top.
"h1" fills in the main title on the page itself
"download" indicates whether the download button should be displayed
"subnav" is a list of panels on the page to navigate through

You can add modal content using a modal helper:

    <% modal "your-modal-id" do %>
      <h1>Modal content here</h1>
    <% end %>

The URL structure has changed slightly. Instead of being located at /community.html,
the page is now located at /community/. Please make sure that all links to images, CSS
and JavaScript are absolute (/js/myjs.js, not js/myjs.js).
